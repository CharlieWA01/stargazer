## In one sentence
A chess engine written from scratch in Rust, aiming for about 1800 on
Lichess as a bot, and playable in any visitor's browser on my portfolio site
through WebAssembly.

## Status
Design stage (Milestone 1 of 6). The engine answers the UCI handshake; the
board design is decided (bitboards plus a 64-square array). No chess played
yet.

## What makes it interesting
- **Two targets from one codebase:** a native engine (chess GUIs, Lichess
  bot) and a WebAssembly build that runs on the visitor's own computer, so
  the website demo costs about $0 and has no server to attack.
- **Proven, not guessed:** move generation is proven with perft (exact
  node counts), and every strength change with SPRT matches.
- **Architecture first:** each component is designed and written down
  before code, with the alternatives and reasons.

## How it's built
With Claude Code as a pair programmer: I set the goals, make the design
decisions, own the repo, CI and infrastructure, and review every PR; Claude
writes the Rust and drafts the docs. I don't write Rust, so the design docs
explain every choice in chess terms.
